# gtdb-trees

This project is about subsetting GTDB trees by leaf taxon (e.g. to contain only
species representative genomes) or by higher taxa, e.g. families.  The former
is typically done with a script while the second task is manual but may start
from a tree subset to e.g. representative genomes to be easier and take less
memory.

# Directories

## `data`

Contains GTDB files plus Makefile(s) that make it easier to collect new data.

## `scripts`

Is for scripts...
